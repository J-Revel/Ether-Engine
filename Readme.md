# Ether Engine

Ether Engine is an attempt to write a 2D game engine that follows the data oriented programming principles, while providing basic tools to be usable for a team with non programmers. My main objective is to be able to use it for game jams, to make sure it is usable for real projects.
It is written in Odin and currently targets only windows.
